            <p>This section contains all the prompts used to create this page.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="image-description">Below is a list of every prompt I used to create this website. CHAT-GPT 4o was used</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Style this webpage, using a blue green color scheme</li>
                <li>Create sections which will represent each "page" (there is a section tag/element in html) for each of the pages that will make up your hobby site. These sections will be within your main:
                    who (this name is a guide- you can change it to be something related, like "About Me" or "About" or "Who we Are")
                    what (this will be your home page- and you can call it home, and it's what should load first, explain what the hobby is about )
                    when (this name is a guide - you can change use it or change it to something like "Best Times" or "Schedule" or "Seasons" or something time related.
                    where (this name is a guide and you can also change it to "best locations" or something like that)
                    how
                    why</li>
                <li>Align body elements to the left, and give it some padding</li>
                <li>don't align body elements, align main elements on the left</li>
                <li>Each section should have an h2 that has the name of that page while the overall page should have a normal heading representing the whole site (as an h1). Each section should have AT MINIMUM three things under the h2... i.e. two paragraphs and a figure, a paragraph and two figures, a table, form, and a figure, etc...  A figure is an img and figcaption. A table counts as a thing. A form counts as a thing. A slideshow counts as a thing. A figure counts as a thing. Make it look nice and be creative. </li>
                <li>create images for each image in the html document</li>
                <li>create an image for cooking-times.jpg</li>
                <li>create an image for market.jpg</li>
                <li>create an image for cooking-why.jpg</li>
                <li>Make all images smaller</li>
                <li>create an image of AI dominating the world</li>
                <li>You must also have an italicized paragraph below each figure.  (Image + figcaption + italicized paragraph explaining prompt = 1 thing) </li>
                <li>create a nav bar that links to each section</li>
                <li>add another section, just like the previous sections, that includes our chat history</li>
                <li>add a new section, similar to the others, that also includes simple instructions on how to cook</li>
            </ul>
