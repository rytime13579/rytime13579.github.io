        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <p>The following websites will be evaluated based off the <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f356b9cde602d320eaee4b2/1702046321541-J6ANBHP2WVEJQVO4X2M2/Screen+Shot+2023-12-08+at+9.35.50+AM.png" target="_blank">CRAP</a> principles in designing a webpage.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft.com</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Color/Contrast
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color and contrast is well done here. As expected, Microsoft's website uses their company's color's to fill the site.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>R - Repitition
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design is consistent throughout the website. Elements are designed in a way that allows the website to flow. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A - Alignment
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elements are Aligned properly and the website flows well as a result. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>P - Proximity
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar elements are grouped together well. The page has a header with a navigation bar and their products are grouped together when you scroll down. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3><a href="https://userinyerface.com/" target="_blank">UserInyerFace.com</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>C - Color/Contrast
                <ul>
                    <li>Awful contrast. Blue on green is an eye sore and hard to look at. Text is inconsistently colored among a plethora of other bad color choices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>R - Repitition
                <ul>
                    <li>Repetition is probably the strongest point of this website, but yet it’s still bad. For instance, at the bottom of the screen the “click here” text isn’t styled properly and the cursor doesn’t even change when you finally find the text that links somewhere. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A - Alignment
                <ul>
                    <li>Alignment isn’t bad, other than almost everything being aligned in the center. Lazy if you ask me. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>P - Proximity
                <ul>
                    <li>Elements are sometimes in good proximity to each other, but it’s inconsistent. This would be ok, but none of the elements do what you expect them to. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
